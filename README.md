# PowerShellDocker
Experience the power of 'PowerShellDocker': PowerShell and Docker, seamlessly combined for script automation using supervisord for a continuously running script ðŸš€
Looking to run your favorite PowerShell scripts seamlessly within Docker containers on a Linux kernel, not as Windows container? Want to be able to put a powershell script in a kubernetes cluster?

With 'PowerShellDocker,' you can achieve continuous PowerShell automation, harnessing the flexibility and scalability of Docker. 
Whether it's scripting, testing, or automating tasks, you can do it! Supervisord ensures the script will run forever, or until you kill the container :)

## Updating modules & packages in Dockerfile

Edit the Dockerfile lines:
```
# Install Powershell modules - Update these to your required modules e.g. AzureRM
RUN pwsh -Command "Install-Module -Name AzureRM  -Force -Scope AllUsers"
```
```
# Install linux packages for system use e.g. nano
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y nano
```

## Variables & Docker
You can add variables to the script that you'd like to be passed through from your docker run command:

Example:

```
$clientId = $env:CLIENT_ID
$clientSecret = $env:CLIENT_SECRET
$tenantId = $env:TENANT_ID
```

You can then provide these in your docker run command:
```
docker run -d \
    --name <dockercontainername> \
    -e CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id> \
    -e CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret> \
    -e TENANT_ID=<your_tenant_id> \
    <yourregistrycontainername>

```
