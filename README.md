# PSDocker
Experience the power of **PSDocker**: PowerShell and Docker, seamlessly combined for script automation using supervisord for a continuously running script ðŸš€
Looking to run your favorite PowerShell scripts seamlessly within Docker containers on a Linux kernel, not as Windows container? Want to be able to put a powershell script in a kubernetes cluster?

With 'PSDocker,' you can achieve continuous PowerShell automation, harnessing the flexibility and scalability of Docker. 
Whether it's scripting, testing, or automating tasks, you can do it! Supervisord ensures the script will run forever, or until you kill the container :)

## Installing modules & packages

Edit the **Dockerfile** lines:
```
# Install Powershell modules - Update these to your required modules e.g. AzureRM
RUN pwsh -Command "Install-Module -Name **AzureRM**  -Force -Scope AllUsers"
```
```
# Install linux packages for system use e.g. nano
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y **nano**
```

## Variables & Docker
You can add variables to the **script.ps1** that you'd like to be passed through from your docker run command:

Script Variable Example:

```
$clientId = $env:CLIENT_ID
$clientSecret = $env:CLIENT_SECRET
$tenantId = $env:TENANT_ID
```

## Build your container
```
docker build <containernametotag> .
docker tag <containernametotag:tag <dockerhubuser>/<containerregistryname>:<tag>
```

## Deploy your container

You can then provide variables in your docker run command:
```
docker run -d \
    --name <dockercontainername> \
    -e CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id> \
    -e CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret> \
    -e TENANT_ID=<your_tenant_id> \
    <registrycontainername:<tag>>

```
